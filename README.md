# Chocolate Server

As in the Mexican expression _eres de chocolate_, this server ain't a production-ready server,
it doesn't count. This server is designed to be barely functional, but easy to configure.

## Launch Server

### 1. Check your node version

```shell
node --version
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```
npm install
```

### 3. Start the server

```
npm start -- custom_config.json
```

## Dependencies

- [Express 4.x](http://expressjs.com/en/api.html)
